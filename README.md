## Description
The app displays popular and top rated movies from [TheMovieDb](https://www.themoviedb.org) in a grid arrangement.
Each movie has its own details activity that displays minimal details about the movie.
The user can store in a SQLite database the list of its favorites movies.
## What I learned
* Fetch data from the Internet with [TheMovieDb](https://www.themoviedb.org) API's.
* Used adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
* Stored favorites movies in a SQLite database and displayed the list
* Implement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailerâ€™s YouTube URL from the movie details screen.
## Libraries
* [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
* [Okhttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/)
